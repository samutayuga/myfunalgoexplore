## Reversing an array in-place
The problem is that we want to reverse a T[] array in O(N) linear time complexity 
and we want the algorithm to be in-place as well - so no additional memory can be used!
For example: input is [1,2,3,4,5] then the output is [5,4,3,2,1]

## Trapping rain water problem overview
Given n non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is 1. 
Compute how much water it can trap after raining!.
Here the elevation map (the input for the algorithm) is [4,1,3,1,5] and the output is the total units of trapped rain water
- which is 7.
Good luck!
