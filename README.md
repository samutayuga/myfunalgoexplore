## Reversing an array in-place

The problem is that we want to reverse a T[] array in O(N) linear time complexity
and we want the algorithm to be in-place as well - so no additional memory can be used!
For example: input is [1,2,3,4,5] then the output is [5,4,3,2,1]

## Trapping rain water problem overview

Given n non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is 1.
Compute how much water it can trap after raining!.
Here the elevation map (the input for the algorithm) is [4,1,3,1,5] and the output is the total units of trapped rain
water

- which is 7.
  Good luck!

## Linked Lists

> Huge advantage, can insert the item at the beginning of the data structure fast `- O(1) running time`
> Huge disadvantage, slow operation to insert items at the end `- O(N) running time`

> `array`, `linked list` and `doubly linked list` does not solve the problem to do arbitrary search with
> faster than O(N) running time complexity
